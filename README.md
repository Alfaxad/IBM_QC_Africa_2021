Quantum computing promises to unlock problem-solving capabilities that could change the world. But which parts of the world might it change? And who will be best positioned to gain the most from this emerging technology? To ensure an ethical and equitable future for quantum computing, it is important that voices from all regional, cultural, and ethnic backgrounds contribute to research and development efforts happening today. This isn’t just a philosophical ideal. For members of the fast-growing African quantum community, and for the global quantum community writ large — it’s a mission of critical importance.


**IBM quantum challenge 2021** took place from 9th September 2021 to 20th September 2021. Developed by African researchers with a particular eye towards engaging African students, researchers, and industry professionals, the challenge aimed to grow the African quantum community and boost participants’ quantum computing skills by guiding them through the application of quantum to problems in agriculture, finance, and chemistry. And by the end of the challenge, participants were able to use qiskit and python to apply quantum computing in real world challenge and kickstart their adventure in Quantum computing.


I am providing my lab solutions(with a cumulative score: 100%) so that anyone who wants to start out with quantum computing can easily get along. For further knowledge about Quantum computing, I recommend  the **qiskit textbook(beta) : https://qiskit.org/textbook-beta** I also recommend the following **lecture series in quantum computing : https://qiskit.org/learn/intro-qc-qh/**. And finally, I recommend  a **youtube series with hands on coding : https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOFEBzvs-Vvp2xg9-POLJhQwtVktlYGbY**


Finally, Qiskit has a community of 20K developers around the world with all levels of experience, you can join and network via 
**Slack: https://ibm.co/joinqiskitslack**, and you can contribute to **qiskit opensource: https://github.com/Qiskit**
